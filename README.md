# Fullstack Open part 3

Deployed at https://fullstack-open-part-3.fly.dev/

This project expands on the previous part's phonebook project. It adds an external MongoDB database
that stores the entries persistently. It also adjusts the app to be hosted on the internet via
Fly.io, with a compiled and minified version of the frontend deployed along with the backend.
It also adds error handling and data validation via middleware, and was also used as an introduction
to using a linter.
